## üìå Purpose

The COREMESH network diagram illustrates how the homelab‚Äôs devices, virtual machines, and VLANs are logically segmented to simulate a realistic enterprise network and Security Operations Center (SOC).

It shows:

- Core infrastructure (Domain Controller, File Server)
- Network edge devices (Firewall, VPN, DNS Filtering)
- Security tools (SIEM, Dashboards, SOC-in-a-Box)
- Attack & defense nodes (Kali, Honeypots, Vulnerability Scanner)
- Segmented VLANs for proper isolation and realistic traffic flow
